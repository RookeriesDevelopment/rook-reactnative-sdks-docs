## Installation

Maven Central

Add the following to your dependencies (app level build.gradle):

```groovy
implementation 'com.rookmotion.android:rook-transmission:version'
```

## Getting started

To get permission for usage you’ll need to install and configure the [rook-auth](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.rookmotion.android/rook-auth) SDK.

### Logging

If you want to see the logs generated by this SDK

When creating an instance of `RookTransmissionManager` provide a logLevel:

```kotlin
RookTransmissionManager(logLevel = "ADVANCED")
```

Available levels:

- “ADVANCED” -> All logs from API. All logs from SDK.
- “BASIC” -> Basic logs from API. All logs from SDK.
- “NONE” -> No logs.

## Usage

Create an instance of `RookTransmissionManager` providing 

- A Context
- An [apiURL](https://docs.tryrook.io/docs/Definitions#api_url) without the HTTPS part, only the api+domain like “api2.rookmotion.dev"
- A [userID](https://docs.tryrook.io/docs/Definitions#user_id)
    - The userID must be registered previously to transmit the data using [rook_users](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.rookmotion.android/rook-users) SDK.
- A [clientUUID](https://docs.tryrook.io/docs/Definitions#client_uuid)
- A [clientPassword](https://docsbeta.tryrook.io/docs/Definitions#client_password)

```kotlin
val manager = RookTransmissionManager(    context,    "api2.rookmotion.dev",    USER_ID,    CLIENT_UUID,    CLIENT_PASSWORD)
```

### Enqueueing

There are multiple functions to enqueue health data they follow the convention `enqueue_data_type` when calling any of these functions you’ll need to provide an instance of the required data type.

Enqueued data will be stored in an internal database until it is uploaded.

To enqueue a Sleep Summary call `enqueueSleepSummary` and provide an instance of `SleepSummaryItem`:

```kotlin
fun enqueueSleep() {    scope.launch {        try {            val item = SleepSummaryItem(                sourceOfData = "Health Connect",                dateTime = "2023-01-06T22:00:22.065Z",                sleepStartDatetime = "2023-01-06T22:00:22.065Z",                sleepEndDatetime = "2023-01-07T12:00:04.013Z",                sleepDate = "2023-01-07",                sleepDurationSeconds = 64800,                timeInBedSeconds = 64800,            )            manager.enqueueSleepSummary(item)            // Success        } catch (e: Exception) {            // Manage error        }    }}
```

Remember to send the dates and datetimes in ISO-8601 format and UTC timezone. (rook_extraction SDKs like [rook_health_connect](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.rookmotion.android/rook-health-connect) already deliver the date with ISO-8601 format UTC timezone).

### Clear queue

If you want to clear queued data so it won’t be sent the next time you perform a syncAll call `clearQueued_data_type`:

```kotlin
fun clearSleepSummaryQueue() {    scope.launch {        try {            manager.clearQueuedSleepSummaries()            // Success        } catch (e: Exception) {            // Manage error        }    }}
```

### Syncing

To sync (send) all enqueued health data call `syncAll`, this will sync all types of data and delete them from the internal Database.

```kotlin
fun syncAll() {    scope.launch {        try {            manager.syncAll()            // Success        } catch (e: Exception) {            // Manage error        }    }}
```

- You can also sync specific types of data these functions will follow the convention: `sync_data_type`.
